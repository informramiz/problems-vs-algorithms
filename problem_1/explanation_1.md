## Square Root Problem

Square root of a number is: a value that can be multiplied by itself to give the given number. Square root of 0 is 0 and 1 is 1. For other numbers, sqrt(n) will always be between [2, n/2] so do a simple binary 
search to find the square root. **As binary search is log(n) so this solution will cost log(n/2) = log(n)**
