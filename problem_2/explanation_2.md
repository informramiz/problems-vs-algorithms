## Problem 2: Rotated Sorted Array Search
### Reasoning
Even though array is rotated, it is still sorted and with a little tweak to the binary search code I was able to use the binary search. 

### Time Efficiency
As the binary is log(n) and I have used binary search so my solution is **log(n)** as required by the problem.

### Space Efficiency
As other than storing 3 variables I don't store anything so my space efficiency is **O(1)**
