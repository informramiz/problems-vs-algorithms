## Problem 6: Max and Min in a Unsorted Array

### Reasoning
It's a simple comparison problem as I traverse the array one time and keep track of min and max and only update either if either encounter a value < min or a value > max.

### Time Efficiency
Solution involves only single traversal and so it is linear time **O(n)**.

### Space Efficiency
Other than 3 variables solution does not store anything so space cost is a constant time **O(1)**.
